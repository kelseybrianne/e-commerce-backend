# E-Commerce Backend üõçÔ∏è

## Description

This is the backend application for an e-commerce site. An Express.js API has been configured so that Sequelize can be used to interact with a MySQL database. The site connected to this backend application would have the ability to use different categories to organize its products and assign any relevant tags to each product.
